### Initialize

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Install the CLI">
    _This is not a production command. Make an install script!_
    
    **Install using curl:**

    <CodeGroup>
    ```curl CURL
    curl -L https://borea.dev/install.sh | bash
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    **Verify the installation:**

    ```
    borea --version
    ```

    You should see an output like this: ```Borea CLI: v.1.1.3```

    If not, rerun the script and verify again.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configure your project">
    Configuring Borea is simple. We'll walk you through the basics on how to generate and use our powerful ```borea.config.json``` file.

    #### Run the `init` command
    ```
    borea init
    ```

    This will generate a default `borea.config.json` file that looks something like this:

        ```json borea.config.json
          {
            "input": {
              "openapi": ["<path_to_spec_or_URL>"]
            },
            "output": {
              "clientSDK": "Formatted OpenAPI Title by default",
              "models": "models",
              "tests": true,
              "xCodeSamples": false
            },
            "ignores": []
          }
        ```

    By default, SDKs and data models are generated. **We highly recommend not changing this.** Tests are a premium feature and are disabled by default, and will not work on the Hobby plan.
    <Note>Command line arguments take precedence over  `borea.config.json`. You can overwrite the settings in the config file by passing the proper flags. For all options and flags, see <a href="/essentials/configuration">configuration</a></Note>

    #### Configuration options

    - `input`:
      - `openapi` - The relative/absolute path or URL to your OpenAPI spec file (json and yaml supported)
    - `output`:
      - `clientSDK` - The name of the SDK when generated. Default is the formatted title in your OpenAPI spec
      - `models` - The name of the folder to hold all the client models
      - `tests` - Enables test generation and running on regeneration
      - `xCodeSamples` - Enables generation of x-Code-Samples to be used in you OpenAPI spec and documentation
    - `ingores` - Folders and files here will be ignored on regeneration, preserving any changes. Glob (gitignore) syntax

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="check" title="Validate your spec">
    <Note>Spec validation is not yet released. As a temporary substitute, we recommend using{' '}

### Generate

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon='wrench' title='Generate SDK'>
    #### Run `generate` command with your API key
    
      ```
      borea generate -k <your_api_key>
      ```

    You can create and manage API keys in your dashboard{' '}
    <a href='https://borea.dev/app/settings'>settings</a>.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon='terminal' title='Add custom code'>
    There are many things that Borea does not yet support out of the box like OAuth, webhooks, and websockets. 
    
    To implement these features, or any others you want, simply add the file or folder to the `ignores` field in `borea.config.json`. 
    Any changes you make to those files or folders will be preserved on regeneration.
      ```json borea.config.json {11}
      {
        "input": {
          "openapi": ["<path_to_spec_or_URL>"]
        },
        "output": {
          "clientSDK": "Formatted OpenAPI Title by default",
          "models": "models",
          "tests": true,
          "xCodeSamples": false
        },
        "ignores": ["webhooks.py", "lib/auth"]
      }
      ```

    <Note>Because of how the ignores system works, the generators will not write over your changes on regeneration,{' '}
    and therefore can lead to that code being misaligned with your API. We are working on a GitHub integration{' '}
    to allow for merge conflict resolution, but in the mean time we recommend you keep change's footprint small.</Note>

### Deploy

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon='message-bot' title='Install our Github app'>
	Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments
	yourself. You can find the link to install on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has
	been successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon='rocket' title='Push your changes'>
	[Commit and push your changes to
	Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) for
	your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that the Github app successfully deployed your
	changes, you can also manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Accordion>
